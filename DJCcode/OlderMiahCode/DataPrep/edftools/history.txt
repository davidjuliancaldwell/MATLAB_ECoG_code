HISTORY:

24 Jun 2002       SDFREAD bug fix of incorrect input argument check
15 Jun 2002 V0.85 SDFOPEN, SDFTELL, SDFSEEK
05 Mar 2002 	  SDFOPEN and SDFERROR Header check of ASCII(0) changed to check for non-printable ASCII characters
			However, some EDF-files do use ASCII(181) or ASCII(230) for µ (micro) in Physical dimension field 
			Therefore, test implemented on <ASCII(32) only. 
13 Feb 2002 V0.84 SDFREAD  bug fixed 
21 Sep 2001 V0.83 SDFERROR bug fixed
 		
 8 Jun 2001 V0.82 SDFOPEN made more compatible to OCTAVE (LOAD FILE_IN_LOADPATH)
13 Oct 2000 	  SDFOPEN reserved1 header included, indicate header modification
 1 Oct 2000 V0.81 SDFOPEN High_Pass_Filter imp|emented 1.0Hz_Hamming 
26 Sep 2000	  ALARM: filter and resampling, Do they work together? Yes, they do!!! Everything is OK. 
18 Sep 2000       SDFWRITE bug fixed
 7 Sep 2000 V0.80 SDFREAD bug fixed
 4 Sep 2000       SDFOPEN, SDFERROR ErrNo 16 modified.
			SDFOPEN079 -> SDFOPEN 
17 Aug 2000	  SDFOPEN->SDFOPEN079, SDFOPEN071->SDFOPEN setback
07 Aug 2000 V0.79 SDFREAD  bug fixed , SDFOPEN revised
02 Aug 2000 V0.79 SDFERROR included, SDFOPEN error handling changed,
                  SDFOPEN block duration check revised  
21 Jul 2000 V0.78 SDFOPEN revised, help text modified.
 3 Jul 2000 V0.78 CONTENTS.M included
   Jun 2000 V0.77 SDFWRITE extended, temporary SDFOPEN-W included, 
07 Jun 2000 V0.77 SDFREAD, SDFOPEN, SDFSEEK modified. 
			Buffer included in order to read data continously, even data is post-processed.
06 Jun 2000 V0.76 SDFREAD changed to units in seconds [before V0.76 the units were records]
15 May 2000 V0.75 SDFSEEK bug fixed
09 May 2000 V0.75 SDFOPEN Mode='w+', writes the header information aftewards, SDFCLOSE modified
			now you can do E=sdfopen('.','r+'), oder 
			E=sdfopen('.','w'), opens tentative EDF-file 
			E=sdfclose(E); writes final Headerinformation using sdfopen('.','w+');
08 May 2000 V0.74 SDFOPEN check of startdate and time improved

30 Jan 2000	  SDFOPEN: error message modified
11 Jan 2000       SDFREAD-mode-OVERFLOW: OVERFLOW = NaN; SDFOPEN: EDF.Calib is sparse
11 Jan 2000 V0.69 SDFREAD: Intermediate variable S(:,EDF.NS) reduced to S(:,length(InChanSelect))
10 Jan 2000 V0.68 SDFOPEN, SDFREAD for QRSdetect0 corrected
