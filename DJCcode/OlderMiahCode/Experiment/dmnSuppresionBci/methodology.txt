% DMN Suppression during BCI and trial to trial performance analysis
% methodology.

% (1) There is a task-correlated suppression of HG activity in DMN
% electrodes

% can be done with epoch based analyses?
% if effect is more suble I could look for a significant decrease in time
% series

% (2) Task performance can be correlated to pre trial power in dmn
% electrodes

% determine HG power during rest and targeting and test for significant
% correlations
