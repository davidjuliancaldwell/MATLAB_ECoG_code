bad electrodes are hand identified
data are common average re-referenced
then downsampled from either 2400 or 1200 to 600 and 1000 to 500 for computational tractability.
the data are notch filtered at 120 and 180 Hz using a 2nd order IIR notch filter
then time-variant power estimates are found by bandpass filtering, performing the hilbert transform, squaring the coefficients and taking the log of this result
this is performed for three signal ranges: HG 70-200, beta 12 18 Hz and LF, 0 - 10 Hz
data are then separated in to trial epochs, which are manually screened for inter-ictal spiking activity and other non-physiological artifacts.



data
5 subjects, looks like all from hmc, all doing the RJB
selection criteria? at least 300 clean BCI epochs using the RJB
How about the DFT? or THE UD?
