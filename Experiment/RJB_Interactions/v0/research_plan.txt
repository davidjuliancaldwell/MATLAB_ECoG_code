1) Electrode selection
  - Controlling electrode (M1)
  - Prefrontal electrode(s): significant change from rest, in BA 9, 10, 46

2) TFA
  - Activity patterns overall / before-after learning in CE and PFE

3) Multi-site interactions
  - Interaction changes between rest and feedback
  - Interaction changes across learning

4) Single-site PAC
  - save for a later date
