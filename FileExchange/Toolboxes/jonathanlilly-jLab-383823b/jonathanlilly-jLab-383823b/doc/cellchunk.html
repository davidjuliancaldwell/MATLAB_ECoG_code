 <a href="cellchunk.html">CELLCHUNK</a>  Converts cell array data into uniform length 'chunks'.
 
    Y=<a href="cellchunk.html">CELLCHUNK</a>(X,L), where X is a cell array of variable-length numerical
    arrays, extracts non-overlapping 'chunks' of the uniform length L and
    returns these in Y, a matrix having L rows.
    
    Successive chunks of length L data in X are become successive columns
    in Y, regardless of the cell to which they initially belonged.  
    Residuals of length less then L at the end of each cell are discarded.
 
    For example:
 
        x{1}=[1 2 3 4]'; x{2}=[5 6 7]'; x{3}=[8 9]'; 
 
        <a href="cellchunk.html">cellchunk</a>(x,2) =  [1 3 5 8]
                          [2 4 6 9]
 
    This is useful, for example, in examining spectra from uniform-length 
    intervals in Lagragnian data such as FLOATS.MAT or DRIFTERS.MAT.
 
    If there is a remainder R in how many times L goes into the length of
    the time series, FLOOR(R/2) points will be thrown away from the
    beginning of the time series and CEIL(R/2) points from the end. 
 
    [Y1,Y2,...,YN]=<a href="cellchunk.html">CELLCHUNK</a>(X1,X2,...,XN,L) also works, where the XN are
    all cell array of the same size.
  
    <a href="cellchunk.html">CELLCHUNK</a> also works when the XN are simply column arrays.
 
    <a href="cellchunk.html">CELLCHUNK</a> with no output arguments overwrite the original named input
    variables.

    Overlap
 
    <a href="cellchunk.html">CELLCHUNK</a>(...,L,'overlap') instead outputs chunks of length L with a 
    50% overlap.  That is, successive columns of the output overlap by L/2.
 
    In this case, remainders are discarded from the ends of the time 
    series, instead of being split between the beginning and the end as in
    the non-overlapping case.  
    __________________________________________________________________   
 
    Parallelization
 
    <a href="cellchunk.html">CELLCHUNK</a>(...,'parallel') parallelizes the computation using a PARFOR 
    loop.  This requires that Matlab's Parallel Computing Toolbox be 
    installed, and is useful for very large datasets.

    '<a href="cellchunk.html">cellchunk</a> --t' runs a test.
 
    Usage: y=<a href="cellchunk.html">cellchunk</a>(x,L);
           [y1,y2,y3]=<a href="cellchunk.html">cellchunk</a>(x1,x2,x3,L);
           [y1,y2,y3]=<a href="cellchunk.html">cellchunk</a>(x1,x2,x3,L,'overlap');
           [y1,y2,y3]=<a href="cellchunk.html">cellchunk</a>(x1,x2,x3,L,'overlap','parallel');
           <a href="cellchunk.html">cellchunk</a>(x1,x2,x3,L);
