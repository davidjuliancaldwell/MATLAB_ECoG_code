 <a href="closedcurves.html">CLOSEDCURVES</a>  Locate and interpolate closed curves in a possibly periodic domain.

    [XC,YC]=<a href="closedcurves.html">CLOSEDCURVES</a>(F,FO) returns closed curves of the matrix F at 
    level FO, i.e. curves where F=FO, as the cell arrays XC and YC.  
 
    If F has N contiguous patches at the contour level FO, then XC and YC
    will be length N cell arrays.  
 
    After rounding, the values of XC will be indices into the *columns* 
    of F, while YC will be indices into the *rows*. 
 
    [XC,YC]=<a href="closedcurves.html">CLOSEDCURVES</a>(X,Y,F,FO) alternately specifies X and Y axes to go
    with F.  X is associated with the *columns* of F and Y with its *rows*.
    The lengths of X and Y must match SIZE(F,2) and SIZE(F,1) respectively.
 
    Use <a href="cellplot.html">CELLPLOT</a>(XC,YC) to plot the curves. 
 
    <a href="closedcurves.html">CLOSEDCURVES</a> works by calling Matlab's CONTOUR routine, re-arranging
    the contour matrix output, and throwing away non-closed contours. 
 
    <a href="closedcurves.html">CLOSEDCURVES</a> has options for considering a periodic domain, and for
    interpolating the curves at a specified resolution, as described below.
 
    The above figure shows closed curves of the Okubo-Weiss parameter P,
    specifically the contour level P = -4 times its own standard deviation,
    in a numerical simulation of quasi-geostrophic (QG) turbulence.

    Periodic extension
   
    <a href="closedcurves.html">CLOSEDCURVES</a> can look for curves within a singly or doubly periodic
    version of the input field F.
 
    <a href="closedcurves.html">CLOSEDCURVES</a>(...,'periodic') will make F doubly periodic before looking
    for closed curves.  
 
    The X and Y axes will be extended based on their regular spacing, and 
    these extended values will be returned in XC and YC for curves that 
    fall into the periodically extended domain. 
 
    <a href="closedcurves.html">CLOSEDCURVES</a>(...,'periodic',N) extends F by N points in all directions.
 
    <a href="closedcurves.html">CLOSEDCURVES</a>(...,'periodic',N,M) extends F by M points at both the left
    and the right (rows), and N points at the top and the bottom (columns).
 
    To apply the periodic extension in only one of the dimesions, use
    <a href="closedcurves.html">CLOSEDCURVES</a>(...,'periodic',N,0) or <a href="closedcurves.html">CLOSEDCURVES</a>(...,'periodic',0,M).
 
    The above figure illustrates the difference between the periodized and
    non-periodized algorithm.  In periodic domain such as this one, closed
    curves at the region boundary will be missed wihtout periodization.
 
    See <a href="periodize.html">PERIODIZE</a> for details.

    Interpolation
 
    <a href="closedcurves.html">CLOSEDCURVES</a> can also interpolate the curves to a specified number of
    points along each curve, in order to increase the spatial resolution.  
 
    [XC,YC]=<a href="closedcurves.html">CLOSEDCURVES</a>(...,'interpolate',NPOINTS) will spline-interpolate
    each curve to be length NPOINTS. 
 
    In this case, XC and YC will be *matrices* instead of cell arrays.  The
    number of rows of XC and YC is then NPOINTS, with each column 
    corresponding to a separate curve.
 
    Choosing a high value of NPOINTS, say NPOINTS=256, will minimize errors
    in integral calculations based on these curves, such as those carried
    out by <a href="curvemoments.html">CURVEMOMENTS</a>.
