 <a href="hodograph.html">HODOGRAPH</a>   Generate hodograph plots (simple and fancy).
 
    A hodograph of a velocity time series is defined as a polar
    coordinate plot of the eastward component versus the northward.
   
    Simple hodographs:
 
      <a href="hodograph.html">HODOGRAPH</a>(U,V) generates a simple hodograph plotting U versus V.
      U and V are column vectors, or matrices with time oriented in
      columns.  
   
      <a href="hodograph.html">HODOGRAPH</a>(CV), where CV=U+iV, also works.
 
    Fancy hodographs:
 
      A fancy hodograph use SCATTER to plot change the color and/or
      sizes of the points according to another parameter, say density.
      A colorbar is also plotted.
 
      <a href="hodograph.html">HODOGRAPH</a>(U,V,C) uses C as the symbol color.  The array C must
      have the same size as U and V.
 
      <a href="hodograph.html">HODOGRAPH</a>(U,V,C,S) also uses S as the symbol size.  The array S
      must have the same size as U and V.
 	
      <a href="hodograph.html">HODOGRAPH</a>(CV,C) and <a href="hodograph.html">HODOGRAPH</a>(CV,C,S) also work.
 
      Note that since SCATTER is slow for large datasets, it is useful
      to decimate the data before plotting.  This is accomplished
      using <a href="hodograph.html">HODOGRAPH</a>(...,INDEX). Then only the points CV(INDEX,:) are
      plotted.
 
      [H,HC]=F<a href="hodograph.html">HODOGRAPH</a>(...) returns the handle H to the data, and the
      handle HC to the colorbar axis.
 
    As an example,
   
           load bravo94
           cv=<a href="vfilt.html">vfilt</a>(bravo.rcm.cv(:,3),24);
           th=100*detrend(bravo.cat.th(:,3));
           [h,hc]=<a href="hodograph.html">hodograph</a>(cv,th,20+0*th,[1:4000]);
           caxis([-8 8])
          
    makes Figure 6a of Lilly and Rhines (2002) JPO.
          
    Usage: <a href="hodograph.html">hodograph</a>(cv);
           [h,hc]=<a href="hodograph.html">hodograph</a>(cv,c,index);
           [h,hc]=<a href="hodograph.html">hodograph</a>(cv,c,s,index);
