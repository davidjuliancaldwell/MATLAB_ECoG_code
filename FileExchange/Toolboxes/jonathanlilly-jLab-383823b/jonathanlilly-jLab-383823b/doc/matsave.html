 <a href="matsave.html">MATSAVE</a>  Create and save structure of variables as a mat-file. 
 
    <a href="matsave.html">MATSAVE</a> NAME X1 X2 ... XN  where X1 ... XN are names of variables in 
    the current workspace, first creates a structure
 
        NAME.X1, NAME.X2, NAME.X3
 
    then saves it as a .mat file called NAME, and finally loads this 
    mat-file into the current workspace.
 
    By default, the mat-file is saved in a directory called 'Matfiles'.
    This directory can be anywhere, but its location must be added to the 
    Matlab search path using ADDPATH, e.g. 'addpath ~/Matfiles'.  
 
    It is preferable to put the ADDPATH statement in your STARTUP file so 
    you do not have to re-enter it every session. 
 
    If a directory called 'Matfiles' is not found, <a href="matsave.html">MATSAVE</a> saves the 
    mat-file to the current directory.  
 
    By default NAME is a string rather than a variable.  However, NAME can 
    also be a variable whose value is a string, through the use of the '-n'
    flag.  Then
 
         <a href="matsave.html">MATSAVE</a> -N VAR X1 ... XN
 
    with VAR='sample' will create a structure named 'sample'.
 
    The version of mat-file format to save in may also be specified through
    the of the -v flag, such that
 
         <a href="matsave.html">MATSAVE</a> -V6 NAME X1 ... XN
 
    will create a structure NAME and save it as a Version 6 mat-file; see 
    SAVE for allowable version options.
 
    See also <a href="make.html">MAKE</a>, <a href="use.html">USE</a>.
 
    Usage:  matsave name x1 x2 x3
            matsave -n var x1 x2 x3
            matsave -v6 -n var x1 x2 x3
