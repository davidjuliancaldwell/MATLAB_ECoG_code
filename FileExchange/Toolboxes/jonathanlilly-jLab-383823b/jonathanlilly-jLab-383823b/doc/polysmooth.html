 <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>  Smoothing scattered 2D data with local polynomial fitting.
 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> generates a map from scattered data in two dimensions---
    either on the plane or on the sphere---using a local least squares fit 
    to a polynomial. 
 
    A numerically efficient algorithm is used that avoids explicit loops. 
    Also, the data are pre-sorted so that different mapping parameters can 
    be tried out at little computational expense.
 
    A reference paper for this function is currently in preparation.  In 
    the meantime, for more details see the following book:
 
       Fan and Gijbels, 1996.  Local polynomial modelling and its 
           applications. Chapman and Hall.

    Smoothing on the plane
 
    Let's say we have an array Z of data is at locations X,Y, where X,Y, 
    and Z are all arrays of the same size.  The problem is to obtain a 
    mapped field ZHAT on some regular grid specified by arrays XO and YO.
 
    Calling <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> is a two-step process: 
 
        [DS,XS,YS,ZS]=<a href="twodsort.html">TWODSORT</a>(X,Y,Z,XO,YO,CUTOFF);
        ZHAT=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(DS,XS,YS,ZS,B,P);
 
    Firstly, <a href="twodsort.html">TWODSORT</a> which returns ZS, a 3D array of data values at each 
    grid point, sorted by increasing distance DS, and the corresponding 
    positions XS and YS. Here XO and YO are arrays specifying the bin 
    center locations of the grid.  See <a href="twodsort.html">TWODSORT</a> for more details.
   
    Here CUTOFF determines the maximum distance included in the sorting 
    and should be chosen to be greater than B.  
 
    Secondly, <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> fits a Pth order polynomial at each gridpoint 
    within a neighborhood specified by the "bandwidth" B.  
 
    Data and grid point locations are presumed to have the same units as
    the bandwidth B (e.g., kilometers).
 
    P may be chosen as P=0 (fit to a constant), P=1 (fit to a plane), or
    else P=2 (fit to a parabolic surface).  
 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> can also be used for data on the sphere, as described next.
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Smoothing on the sphere
 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> supports a local polynomial fit on the sphere.  As before 
    this is a two-step process:
 
        [DS,XS,YS,ZS]=<a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a>(LAT,LON,Z,LATO,LONO,CUTOFF);
        ZHAT=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(DS,XS,YS,ZS,B,P,'sphere') 
 
    Firstly one calls <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a>, which is the analogue of <a href="twodsort.html">TWODSORT</a> for the 
    sphere.  LATO and LONO are arrays specifying the bin center locations 
    of the grid.  See <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a> for more details.
 
    Secondly, <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> fits a Pth order polynomial at each gridpoint 
    within a neighborhood specified by the "bandwidth" B.  The bandwidth 
    here should have units of kilometers. 
 
    Note that <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a> and <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> both assume the sphere to be the 
    radius of the earth, as specified by the function <a href="radearth.html">RADEARTH</a>.
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Multiple bandwidths
 
    Note that the bandwidth B may be an array, in which case ZHAT, as well
    as the other output fields described below, will have LENGTH(B) 'pages'
    along their third dimensions.
 
    This can result in a significant speed improvement compared with 
    calling <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> by looping over multiple bandwith values.  The 
    reason is that <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> performs a computationally expensive initial
    sort to remove non-finite values from the grid.  In calling POLYSMOOTH
    with an array-valued B, this sort only need to be performed one time.
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Additional options
    
    A number of different options are possible, as descibed below.  These  
    are specified with trailing string arguments, which can be given in any
    order provided they are after the numeric arguments.
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Weighting function
 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> weights the data points in the vicinity of each grid point
    according to some decaying function of distance.
 
    1) Parabolic weighting
 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(...,'epa'), the default behavior, uses the Epanechnikov  
    kernel --- a fancy name for a parabolic weighting function.  This  
    function vanishes outside a radius of the bandwidth B.  
 
    The Epanechnikov kernel has the numerical advantage that distances from 
    far away points do not have to be computed, and is therefore preferred.
 
    2) Gaussian weighting:
 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(...,'gau') uses a Gaussian weighting function instead, again
    vanishing outside of radius B, and with a standard deviation of B/3. 
    That is, the points more than 3-sigma from the center are set to zero.
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Additional output arguments
 
    [ZHAT,R,N,C]=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(...) returns the weighted average distance R of
    all the data points used at each grid point, the number N of such data
    points, and the condition number C.  All are the same size as ZHAT.
 
    R is computed using the same weighting function as for the mapping. 
    Large R values mean that a typical data point contribution was far from
    the current grid point, indicated that ZHAT is potentially biased.   
 
    For uniform data spacing with the Epanechnikov kernel, the weighted 
    mean radius R is 0.533*B, while for the Gaussian kernel it is 0.410*B.
 
    Small numbers N of enclosed data points means that little averaging was
    involved, indicating that the values of ZHAT may be more subject to
    variance, and/or less representative, than at points where N is large.
 
    Note that R includes the effect of the additional weighting factor, if
    input as described below, whereaas N does not.
 
    The matrix condition number C is computed by COND.  At points where C
    is large, the least squares solution may be unstable, and one should 
    consider reverting to a lower-order solution.  Note that for zeroth-
    order fit with P=0, the matrix condition number is equal to one. 
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Estimated derivatives
 
    As a part of the least squares problem, derivatives of order P and
    lower are estimated as a part of the Pth-order fit. 
 
    [ZHAT,R,N,C,ZX,ZY]=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(...) with P>1 returns the estimated X and 
    Y, or zonal and meridional, derivatives of Z. 
 
    [ZHAT,R,N,C,ZX,ZY,ZXX,ZXY,ZYY]=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(...) with P=2 similarly
    returns the estimated second partial derivatives of Z.
 
    Derivative fields are set to values of NaNs if they are not explicitly
    computed, so for example, [ZHAT,R,N,C,ZX,ZY]=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(...) with P=0 
    will lead to ZX and ZY being arrays of NaNs of the same size as ZHAT.
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Variable bandwidth
 
    ZHAT=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(...,N,P,'variable') uses the parameter N instead of a
    fixed bandwidth.  The bandwidth now varies over the grid such that N
    points fall within one bandwidth distance from every grid point.
    
    [ZHAT,R,B,C]=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(...,N,P,'variable') returns as its third output 
    argument the bandwidth B at each gridpoint rthat than the total number
    of data points N.  All other output arguments are unchanged. 
 
    The variable bandwidth algorithm can give good results when the data
    spacing is highly uneven, particularly when used with a higher-order
    (P=1 or P=2) fit.  
 
    Derivative fields may also be output in this case, as described above.
 
    When using the variable bandwidth method, be aware that the bandwidth
    necessary to include N points may turn out to be larger than CUTOFF,
    the maximum distance value given to <a href="twodsort.html">TWODSORT</a> or <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a>.  
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Weighted data points
 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> can incorporate an additional weighting factor on the data
    points. Let W be an array of positive values the same size as the data 
    array Z.  Each data point is then treated as if it were W data points.
 
    To use weighted data points, call <a href="twodsort.html">TWODSORT</a> or <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a> with W added:
 
        [DS,XS,YS,ZS,WS]=<a href="twodsort.html">TWODSORT</a>(X,Y,Z,W,XO,YO,CUTOFF);           
     or [DS,XS,YS,ZS,WS]=<a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a>(LAT,LON,Z,W,LATO,LONO,CUTOFF); 
     
    followed by    ZHAT=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(DS,XS,YS,ZS,WS,B,P);
             or    ZHAT=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(DS,XS,YS,ZS,WS,B,P,'sphere');
 
    for data distributed on the plane or on the sphere, respectively.
 
    For very large datasets, this may be useful in first condensing the 
    data into a manageable size, or alternatively it may be used to weight
    observations according to a measure of their presumed quality.

    Algorithms 
 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> has several algorithm choices for optimal performance, both  
    of which give identical answers.
 
    1) Speed optimization
 
    The default algorithm is optimized for speed but uses a great deal of 
    memory.  It solves the least squares problem for all grid points
    simultaneously (by directly solving matrix inversions---see <a href="matinv.html">MATINV</a>.)
 
    This can be greater than an order of magnitude faster than the obvious 
    approach of looping over the grid points.
  
    2) Memory optimization
 
    ZHAT=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(DS,XS,YS,ZS,B,P,'memory') performs an explicit loop. 
    This is mostly used for testing, purposes, but may also be useful if
    the dataset is so large that memory becomes a limiting factor.
