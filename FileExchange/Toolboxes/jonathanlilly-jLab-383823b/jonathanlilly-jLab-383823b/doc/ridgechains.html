 <a href="ridgechains.html">RIDGECHAINS</a>  Forms ridge curves by connecting transform ridge points.
 
    <a href="ridgechains.html">RIDGECHAINS</a> is a low-level function called by <a href="ridgewalk.html">RIDGEWALK</a>.
 
    [ID,IR,JR,WR]=<a href="ridgechains.html">RIDGECHAINS</a>(N,BOOL,W) forms chains of ridge points of
    wavelet transform W.  
 
    Ridge points are all points of W for which BOOL, a matrix of the same
    size as W, is true.  Only ridges with at least N periods are returned.
    
    ID is a unique ID number assigned to each ridge.  IR and JR are the 
    time- and scale-indices along the ridges.  WR is the wavelet transform 
    along the ridge. 
  
    All output variables are the same size.
  
    See also <a href="ridgewalk.html">RIDGEWALK</a>.
 
    Usage:  [id,ii,jj,xr]=<a href="ridgechains.html">ridgechains</a>(N,bool,x);
