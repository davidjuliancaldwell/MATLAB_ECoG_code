 <a href="stickvect.html">STICKVECT</a> Plots "stick vectors" for multicomponent velocity time series.
   
    <a href="stickvect.html">STICKVECT</a>(TIME,SCALE,U,V), where U and V are measurements of
    "eastward" and "northward" velocities respectively, represents the
    velocity points as vectors strung out along the x-axis.
 
    The vector TIME is used as the x-axis, and SCALE is the stretching
    factor used to map U values onto TIME.  SCALE velocity units
    correspond to one X unit. The aspect ratio of the plot is set so
    that angles are not distorted: the point (U,V)=(1,1) will make a
    45 degree angle.
 
    <a href="stickvect.html">STICKVECT</a>(TIME,SCALE,U,V,NSTICKS) plots only NSTICKS vectors
    evenly spaced throughout the length of the input vectors.
 
    <a href="stickvect.html">STICKVECT</a> may also be used with multicomponent time series. In
    this case U and V are matrices the columns of which are distinct
    time series from (for example) different depths.
  
    <a href="stickvect.html">STICKVECT</a>(TIME,SCALE,U,V,NSTICKS,SHIFT), when U and V are
    matrices, will offset the stickvector lines in the vertical by
    amount SHIFT. SHIFT may either be a scalar, denoting the offset
    between adjacent time series, a vector containing the "baseline"
    values for each instrument, or a matrix of same size as U and V.
    TIME may be a vector, or it may be a matrix of the same size as U
    and V if the time-axes are not all the same.
 	
    <a href="stickvect.html">STICKVECT</a>(TIME,CV,...), where CV=U+iV, also works.
 
    <a href="stickvect.html">STICKVECT</a> plots a small diagonal line in the upper right-hand
    corner of the plot, which should be at a 45 degree angle; this
    provides a check that the aspect ratio is correct.  
   
    H=<a href="stickvect.html">STICKVECT</a>(...) returns a vector containing handles to the
    stickvector lines of the various time series.
 
    To adjust the appearance of the plot, first vary SCALE and then
    vary NSTICKS.
 	
    As an example,  
   
          load bravo94
          cv=<a href="vfilt.html">vfilt</a>(bravo.rcm.cv,100);
          <a href="stickvect.html">stickvect</a>(bravo.rcm.yearf,180,cv,300,-30);
  
    recreates the upper part of Fig. 24 of Lilly et. al JPO 1999. 
    This may be run by typing '<a href="stickvect.html">stickvect</a> --f'.
 		
    Usage:  <a href="stickvect.html">stickvect</a>(time,scale,u,v);
            <a href="stickvect.html">stickvect</a>(time,scale,u,v,nsticks);
            <a href="stickvect.html">stickvect</a>(time,scale,u,v,nsticks,shift);
