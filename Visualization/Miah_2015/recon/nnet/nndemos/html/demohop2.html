%% Hopfield Unstable Equilibria
% A Hopfield network is designed with target stable points.  However, while
% NEWHOP finds a solution with the minimum number of unspecified stable points,
% they do often occur.  The Hopfield network designed here is shown to have an
% undesired equilibrium point.  However, these points are unstable in that any
% noise in the system will move the network out of them.

% The function NEWHOP creates Hopfield networks given the stable points T.

% Here we define a random starting point and simulate the Hopfield network for
