%%
% We would like to obtain a Hopfield network that has the four stable points
% defined by the two target (column) vectors in T.

T = [+1 +1 -1 +1; ...
      -1 +1 +1 -1; ... 
      -1 -1 -1 +1; ...
      +1 +1 +1 +1; ...
      -1 -1 +1 +1];

%%
% The function NEWHOP creates Hopfield networks given the stable points T.

net = newhop(T);

%%
% Here we define 4 random starting points and simulate the Hopfield network for
% 50 steps.
%
% Some initial conditions will lead to desired stable points.  Others will lead
% to undesired stable points.

P = {rands(5,4)};
[Y,Pf,Af] = net({4 50},{},P);
Y{end}
