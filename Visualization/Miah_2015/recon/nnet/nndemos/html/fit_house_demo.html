%% House Price Estimation
% This example illustrates how a function fitting neural network can estimate
% median house prices for a neighborhood based on neighborhood demographics.

%% The Problem: Estimate House Values
% In this example we attempt to build a neural network that can estimate
% the median price of a home in a neighborhood described by thirteen
% demographic attributes:
%
%     1. Per capita crime rate per town
%     2. Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
%     3. proportion of non-retail business acres per town
%     4. 1 if tract bounds Charles river, 0 otherwise
%     5. Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
%     6. Average number of rooms per dwelling
%     7. Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
%     8. Weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
%     9. Index of accessibility to radial highways
%    10. Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
%    11. Pupil-teacher ratio by town
%    12. 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2
%    13. Percent lower status of the population
%
% This is an example of a fitting problem, where inputs are matched up to
% associated target outputs, and we would like to create a neural network
% which not only estimates the known targets given known inputs, but can
% generalize to accurately estimate outputs for inputs that were not
% used to design the solution.
%
%% Why Neural Networks?
% Neural networks are very good at function fit problems.  A neural network
% with enough elements (called neurons) can fit any data with arbitrary
% accuracy. They are particularly well suited for addressing non-linear
% problems. Given the non-linear nature of real world phenomena, like
% house valuation, neural networks are a good candidate for solving
% the problem.
%
% The thirteeen neighborhood attributes will act as inputs to a neural
% network, and the median home price will be the target.
%
% The network will be designed by using the attributes of neighborhoods
% whose median house value is already known to train it to produce
% the target valuations.
%
%% Preparing the Data
% Data for function fitting problems are set up for a neural network by
% organizing the data into two matrices, the input matrix X and the target
% matrix T.
%
% Each ith column of the input matrix will have thirteen elements
% representing a neighborhood whose median house value is already known.
% 
% Each corresponding column of the target matrix will have one element,
% representing the median house price in 1000's of dollars.
%
% Here such a dataset is loaded.

[x,t] = house_dataset;

%%
% We can view the sizes of inputs X and targets T.
%
% Note that both X and T have 506 columns. These represent 506 neighborhood
% attributes (inputs) and associated median house values (targets).
%
% Input matrix X has thirteen rows, for the thirteen attributes. Target
% matrix T has only one row, as for each example we only have one desired
% output, the median house value.

size(x)
size(t)

%% Fitting a Function with a Neural Network
% The next step is to create a neural network that will learn to estimate
% median house values.
%
% Since the neural network starts with random initial weights, the results
% of this example will differ slightly every time it is run. The random seed
% is set to avoid this randomness. However this is not necessary for your
% own applications.

% Two-layer (i.e. one-hidden-layer) feed forward neural networks can fit
% any input-output relationship given enough neurons in the hidden layer.
% Layers which are not output layers are called hidden layers.
%
% We will try a single hidden layer of 10 neurons for this example. In
% general, more difficult problems require more neurons, and perhaps more
% layers.  Simpler problems require fewer neurons.
%
% The input and output have sizes of 0 because the network has not yet
% been configured to match our input and target data.  This will happen
% when the network is trained.

net = fitnet(10);
view(net)

%%
% Now the network is ready to be trained. The samples are automatically
% divided into training, validation and test sets. The training set is
% used to teach the network. Training continues as long as the network
% continues improving on the validation set. The test set provides a
% completely independent measure of network accuracy.
%
% The NN Training Tool shows the network being trained and the algorithms
% used to train it.  It also displays the training state during training
% and the criteria which stopped training will be highlighted in green.
%
% The buttons at the bottom  open useful plots which can be opened during
% and after training.  Links next to the algorithm names and plot buttons
% open documentation on those subjects.

[net,tr] = train(net,x,t);

%%
% To see how the network's performance improved during training, either
% click the "Performance" button in the training tool, or call PLOTPERFORM.
%
% Performance is measured in terms of mean squared error, and shown in
% log scale.  It rapidly decreased as the network was trained.
%
% Performance is shown for each of the training, validation and test sets.
% The version of the network that did best on the validation set is
% was after training.

plotperform(tr)

%% Testing the Neural Network
% The mean squared error of the trained neural network can now be measured
% with respect to the testing samples. This will give us a sense of how
% well the network will do when applied to data from the real world.

testX = x(:,tr.testInd);
testT = t(:,tr.testInd);

testY = net(testX);

perf = mse(net,testT,testY)

%%
% Another measure of how well the neural network has fit the data is the
% regression plot.  Here the regression is plotted across all samples.
%
% The regression plot shows the actual network outputs plotted in terms of
% the associated target values.  If the network has learned to fit the
% data well, the linear fit to this output-target relationship should
% closely intersect the bottom-left and top-right corners of the plot.
%
% If this is not the case then further training, or training a network
% with more hidden neurons, would be advisable.

y = net(x);

plotregression(t,y)

%%
% Another third measure of how well the neural network has fit data is the
% error histogram.  This shows how the error sizes are distributed. 
% Typically most errors are near zero, with very few errors far from that.

e = t - y;
