%
% This property consists of a row cell array of strings, defining the
% <a href="matlab:doc nnplot">plot functions</a> associated with a network. The neural network training
% window, which is launched by the train function, shows a button for each
% <a href="matlab:doc nnplot">plot function</a>. Click the button during or after training to open the
% desired plot.
%
% Side Effects:
%
% Whenever this property is altered, the network's plot parameters
% (net.<a href="matlab:doc nnproperty.net_plotParams">plotParams</a>) are set to contain the parameters and default values of
% the new function.
